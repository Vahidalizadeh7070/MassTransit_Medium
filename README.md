# Microservices and MassTransit
MassTransit implementation will be discussed in this repo, and how it could share messages betweenÂ .NET microservices. In the previous article (Using RabbitMQ in Microservices) (1), simple microservices have been implemented and shared messages by the RabbitMQ between services. Now, here, it will be implemented by MassTransit. The scenario would be straightforward, and other aspects will be explained in the following articles. So, please read the last article for more information about what will be implemented. Let's go ahead and get started. <br/><br/><br/>
